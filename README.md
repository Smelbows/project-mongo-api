# Mongo API Project

I took data from a formula 1 API and then reformated it and added it to a MONGO database using the mongoose library. I then created three GET endpoints for the data and deployed the API to heroku.

## The problem

I used the MONGOdb cloud service and the mongo db compass tool to view the database. I took data from a local json and used mongoose models and schemas to add the data from the json into the database for the  first time.

For continuation, when the data is displayed on a local server, the races are not necessarily displayed in any particular order. I'd like to look into sorting the data in the first endpoint, and creating some more endpoints.
